        <h3>What are the Early Signs and Symptoms of Diabetes</h3>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The cost and suffering of diabetes pose a heavy burden on individual patients as well as healthcare systems throughout the world. According to estimates, 101 million people in India alone are diabetic, of which 50% account for undiagnosed or unaware of their diabetic status. The symptoms of diabetes were first identified in medical Greek literature and diabetes was named by the noted Greek physician Aretaeus. In this blog let us understand more about diabetes, symptoms and importance of early diagnosis.</p>
        <h3>Understanding Diabetes</h3>
        <p>The incapacity of the body to handle and control blood glucose levels is the hallmark of diabetes, a chronic medical illness. Insulin is a hormone that the human body produces controls and uses extra glucose. Patients with diabetes either lose or have limited use of this skill, which causes their blood glucose levels to rise steadily. Scientists could identify the actual physical symptoms and signs of diabetes 1,500 years ago. They termed diabetes as a "sweet urine" condition due to the presence of high levels of sugar in the urine of diabetic people. Modern advancements in medical sciences have helped medical authorities treat and cure diabetes symptoms sporadically.

Diabetes Type 1 and Type 2 are regarded as chronic illnesses. Every type of diabetes has a unique underlying cause. However, if you have diabetes of any kind, your blood sugar levels are already raised. Excessive blood sugar levels might lead to serious health problems. Although diabetes has no cure, the condition can be reversed with symptom identification, regular consultation with healthcare provider and lifestyle modification.</p>
