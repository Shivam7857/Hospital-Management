        <p class="card-text">In a poignant account, Mr. Rajdeep narrates his grandfather's ordeal. His right hand's grip weakened, causing falls and difficulties. Local doctors attempted treatment, but his condition deteriorated. Seeking alternatives, they explored Ayurveda to no avail. Their hope dwindled until a critical moment when he suffered a fall resulting in a potential fracture. Desperate, they turned to Dr. Man Mohan Mehndiratta, Principal Director, Neurology, and Dr. Vinit Banga’s, Associate Director, Neurology and Head, Neurovascular Intervention. Mini-strokes were identified as the cause, linked to constricted blood vessels in the brain due to smoking and hypertension. Brain stenting was the uncommon but essential solution. </p>
